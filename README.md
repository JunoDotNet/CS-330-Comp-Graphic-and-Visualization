# CS-330-Comp-Graphic-and-Visualization
Project Overview
This repository contains the final project for CS 330: Computer Graphics and Visualization. The project showcases a 3D scene created using OpenGL, demonstrating my ability to design and develop a fully realized 3D world.

# Reflection
Software Design Approach
I approach software design by first understanding the project requirements before I began designing. This project enhanced my skills in modular design and using transformations to create complex 3D objects.

Development Process
I employed iterative development, constantly testing and refining the 3D scene. I focused on improving my use of shaders and lighting, which evolved significantly throughout the project. Additionally, I added camera movement controlled by wasd keys. 

Application of Skills
The skills gained in computational graphics, including an understanding of 3D transformations and lighting, will be valuable in future software development, particularly in fields involving simulations or game development.
